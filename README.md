StrawPoll-AutoVote is a Python command line application designed to automate voting on StrawPolls. It utilizes proxy servers to distribute requests and allows for parallel execution to speed up the voting process.

## Prerequisites

Before using this application, make sure you have the following:

1.  Python 3.x installed on your system.
2.  A list of proxy servers in a text file, e.g., `http_proxies.txt`, with each proxy formatted as `IP:Port` on a new line.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the repository's directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd StrawPoll-AutoVote
    ```
    
3.  Install the required dependencies using pip:
    
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    

## Usage

To start the application, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 main.py --poll <poll_id> --vote <answer_id> --proxies http_proxies.txt --threads <num_threads>
```

Replace the placeholders with appropriate values:

-   `<poll_id>`: The ID of the StrawPoll you want to vote on.
-   `<answer_id>`: The ID of the answer option you want to vote for.
-   `http_proxies.txt`: The path to the proxy list text file.
-   `<num_threads>`: The maximum number of threads to run in parallel. If not specified, the application will use the maximum available threads.

Example:

```bash
python3 main.py --poll kogjkj7d1Z6 --vote mpnbP4V5GZ5 --proxies http_proxies.txt --threads 24
```
